#Scripts to build Azuer Kinect SDK on Ubuntu#

##Works on##
This has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04


##Dependencies##
- docker
  `apt install -y docker`
- Git
  `apt install -y git`


# Temporary solution # 
NB: this is a temporary solution.  The best solution would be to modify the docker image to use ubuntu 22.04 (or whatever latest build environment) then attempt compilation and fix all issues that come up.
